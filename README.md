## What I learned

In this project, I realized how much my coding skills have improved over the past year. My first portfolio website was clunkier and took much longer to code. I am much happier with my new portfolio page.

Here are several things I learned throughout this project:

1. **_Tailwind CSS Animation_** - I explored Tailwind CSS animation features and found them exciting. I experimented with various options and settled on the pulse and bounce animations with a set duration, adding a simple yet fun element to the website.


## Continued development

I will continue to learn more about TailwindCSS, ReactJS and updating my process of building a website. I will continue creating original projects, frontend mentor challenges and much more.

My next goal with this project is to change the domain from my old portfolio website and add it to this new one. Additionally, I want to keep creating more projects to add to this portfolio and also make the website more interactive.
